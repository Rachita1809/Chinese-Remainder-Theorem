<p><b>Application:</b>Most implementations of RSA use the Chinese remainder theorem during signing of HTTPS certificates and during decryption.

The Chinese remainder theorem can also be used in secret sharing, which consists of distributing a set of shares among a group of people who, all together (but no one alone), can recover a certain secret from the given set of shares. Each of the shares is represented in a congruence, and the solution of the system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem is the secret to be recovered. Secret sharing using the Chinese remainder theorem uses, along with the Chinese remainder theorem, special sequences of integers that guarantee the impossibility of recovering the secret from a set of shares with less than a certain cardinality.</p><br />
 <p><b>Conclusion:</b>Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, you can solve congruences and inequalities more efficiently than any remainder theorem or factor theorem. The Chinese Remainder Theorem if moduleo elements are not relative prime than,CRT for that set of equation does not exist.If equations are relative prime,but if M inverse dosen't exist for any one equation then also CRT is not applicable .
  In short we can say that,CRT is applicable to particular set of equation,if all moduleo elements are relatively co-prime and inverse exists for ever moduleo elements.</p>
